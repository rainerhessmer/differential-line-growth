# Differential Line Growth

Port of Anders Hoff's Python based implementation of [differential line growth](http://inconvergent.net/generative/differential-line/) to JavaScript and OpenProcessing.

Big thanks to Anders Hoff for sharing the code behind his generative art and for the associated [write-ups](http://inconvergent.net/generative/).

## Web
Live link: [differentialLineGrowth.html](http://hessmer.org/generative/differential-line-growth/differentialLineGrowth.html)

## Processing
The Processing code resides in the Processing subfolder. It also contains KdTree.pde, an implementation of KD Tree based on the JavaScript implementation by [Ubilabs](https://github.com/ubilabs/kd-tree-javascript).

Press 'p' to pause the execution; press ' ' (spacebar) to save the output as an svg file.
